{"data":{"contentfulAbout":{"aboutMe":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"rawMarkdownBody":"Hello and thanks for visiting my website. I am a software engineer from Tuscaloosa Alabama currently working in the NYC area. In college I used my web dev talents to give local companies in the Tuscaloosa area a web presence and afterward enjoyed a brief stint as a professional poker player. After a couple of years I re-engaged with my original passion of web development and enrolled at Fullstack Academy of Code to further my skills into being a fullstack software engineer. I am currently working at Blackbird LLC as a software engineer creating user interfaces for hedge fund traders and investors using Node.js."}},"profile":{"title":"William Golden","image":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/63iwos4r5sbc/6nf3rNaaVaUqYcoAcciSeC/9e9f688d43a179ec77dbc781dd5c158e/IMG_2236__1_.jpg.png?w=450&fl=progressive&q=100"}}}}}
